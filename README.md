Before proceeding further it is very important to clearly understand square numbers. Multiplication is the process of calculating one number by another. What does it mean when someone says the square of a number? To square a number means to multiply it by itself.

## Example 1:

        * 2 multiplied by 2 is equal to 4
        * There is a shorter way to write 2 * 2. It is written as 22
        * It is also called 2 squared or 2 to the 2nd power

## Example 2:

        * 5 multiplied by 5 is equal to 25
        * There is a shorter way to write 5 * 5. It is written as 52
        * It is also called 5 squared or 5 to the 2nd power

A square root of a number is another number which when multiplied by itself gives back the original number. Methods to find square root: 1. The method of repeated subtraction 2. Prime factorization method 3. Long division method. There are certain square root rules that need to be followed while calculating the square root. The symbol used to denote the root of a number is called radical. Every radical has 3 parts: radical symbol, index, radicand.

## Examples

### Example 1:

        * Square root of 36 is 6
        * Written as √36 = 6 because 6 * 6 = 62 = 36

### Example 2:

        * Square root of 25 is 5
        * Written as √25 = 5 because 5 * 5 = 52 = 25
